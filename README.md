Gitpod Cloud Development Environment (CDE) Experiment
====

The `devcontainer.json` refers to the Dockerfile which controls the tools available in your environment.
In this experiment it's base is Ubuntu with VS Code included. Some tools and additional libs are installed therein via apt and git clone.
Additionally it configures the VS Code extensions that are included in the remote environment.

To forward the locally attached HW start with making it available in the local WSL Ubuntu.
Powershell
```
plugin STM32 dev kit
usbipd list
usbipd bind -i 0483:374b
usbipd attach --wsl -i 0483:374b
```  

WSL:
```
lsusb
ls -l /dev/bus/usb/001/005
```

Flash via `st-flash --debug write main.bin 0x08000000`

USB port forward
====
To forward a local ST-Link to a cloud-based VM, you can use USB over IP solutions. One such solution is `usbip`, which allows you to share USB devices over the network. Here are the steps to set it up:

### On Your Local Machine:

1. **Install `usbip`**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install usbip
   sudo apt-get install linux-tools-$(uname -r)
   ```

2. **Load USBIP Kernel Modules**:
   ```sh
   sudo modprobe usbip-core
   sudo modprobe usbip-host
   sudo modprobe vhci-hcd
   ```

3. **List USB Devices**:
   ```sh
   usbip list -l
   ```

4. **Bind the ST-Link Device**:
   - Find the bus ID of your ST-Link device from the previous command's output.
   ```sh
   sudo usbip bind -b <busid>
   ```

5. **Start USBIP Daemon**:
   ```sh
   sudo usbipd -D
   ```

### On Your Cloud VM:

1. **Install `usbip`**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install usbip
   sudo apt-get install linux-tools-$(uname -r)
   ```

2. **Load USBIP Kernel Modules**:
   ```sh
   sudo modprobe usbip-core
   sudo modprobe vhci-hcd
   ```

3. **Attach the USB Device**:
   - Replace `<local-machine-ip>` with the IP address of your local machine.
   ```sh
   sudo usbip attach -r <local-machine-ip> -b <busid>
   ```

4. **Verify the Device**:
   ```sh
   lsusb
   ```

### Example:

Assuming the bus ID of your ST-Link device is `1-1` and your local machine's IP address is `192.168.1.100`:

**On Local Machine**:
```sh
sudo usbip bind -b 1-1
sudo usbipd -D
```

**On Cloud VM**:
```sh
sudo usbip attach -r 192.168.1.100 -b 1-1
lsusb
```

This setup should allow you to forward your local ST-Link to your cloud-based VM and use it for debugging your embedded project.

STM32
=====

This is a repo for my various smaller [STM32 MCU](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html) projects.  Below you'll see a number of examples for the [STM32F411 development board](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f411.html?querycriteria=productId=LN1877) and the [STM32F429 dev board](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html).  For many of these projects I *_do not_* use the STM HAL or Standard Peripheral Library.  I do this for the sake of understanding and demonstrating how the STM32F4 and peripherals work at their lowest levels.  All of these examples are well commented, explaining what each non-obvious line of code is doing, frequently referencing datasheet pages for detailed information and explanation.

Each example simply contains the source code, startup code and a makefile for the project.  Few of the projects have external software dependencies.  Those that do will be noted in the description.  Following [simple steps](STM32F411/BlinkLightsCommandLine/README.md), you should be able to easily build these examples from the command line using the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain.  Or, if you prefer, you should be able to easily load the source code into your favorite IDE/toolchain to build/run the examples from it.

**STM32F411 Index**
-   [**ArmCortexM4Analysis**](STM32F411/ArmCortexM4Analysis/README.md): This program is used in my blog post [In Depth Analysis of an ARM Cortex-M4 Program](https://tmdarwen.com/in-depth-analysis-of-an-arm-cortex-m4-program.html).
-   [**BlinkLightsCommandLine**](STM32F411/BlinkLightsCommandLine/README.md): This example simply blinks the onboard LEDs.  Although a simple program, its importance is that it shows how to compile and debug entirely on the command line using GCC and GDB.  
-   **HighSpeedClock**: This example shows how to configure the CPU clock speed to the maximum rate (100 MHz).
-   **OnboardAccelerometer**: The STM32F411 development board has an [LSM303DLHC accelerometer](http://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lsm303dlhc.html) included on the board.  This example initializes the accelerometer and continually reads x, y, z axes from it displaying the values in realtime to a terminal program using UART.
-   [**OnboardAudioOutput**](STM32F411/OnboardAudioOutput): This example outputs a stereo, 16 bit sine wave tone from the [CS43L22 DAC](https://www.cirrus.com/products/cs43l22/) which comes onboard the STM32F411 development board.
